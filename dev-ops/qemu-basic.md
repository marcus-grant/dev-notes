# Running Highly Performant Linux VMs using KVM & QEMU
After a while of playing around with this software stack, I have really grown to love to be able to bte in complete control over every aspect of a virtual machine manager (**QEMU**) and hypervisor (**KVM**). The real magic lies in the fact that KVM is a hypervisor, which essentially means that even the hardware on the host, meaning storage I/O, memory I/O, USB I/O, and even PCI-Express devices like GPU's. For this guide, only a virtual display device will be used, and eventually disabled because the result of this guide will only be a headless Ubuntu server, which is very useful for testing things like web servers and applications. [Part 2]() of this series will cover how to create a more powerful VM instance that you can even install Windows on to play games with at near native performance and I will prove just how *near-native* it is. In [Part 3]() I'll cover the various optimizations you can make, and how to create python scripts to further automate managing your VM's, be it for your web-server, test-servers, or even a VM workstation, which I recommend every computer nerd [build]()
