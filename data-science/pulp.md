# Linear Optimization using Python with PULP

If a set of equations are linear, with independant variables and constraints, linear programming can be used to come up with an optimal solution for those variables. For the more basic problems, PULP can be quite sufficient wihtout having to perform excessive explicit matrix methods using sciPy/numPy.

To start, get a hold of the library for your python environment by using `pip` or `pip3` and install the python module `pulp` like so: `pip install pulp`. If you're already using anaconda, then this package should already be installed. Personally, due to the other uses I have for python, I prefer to manage my own python environment. But if you are predimonantly using python for data science and mathematical computation, then the Python platform [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) can be quite convenient.
