Long Term Plans of Study for Computer Science
=============================================

Coming from Electrical Engineering and teaching myself to code and work with complex computing systems both personally & professionally, I've felt that something is missing in those interests. I never had a formal Computer Science education and may want to do academic research in those fields in one day. Best I brushed up on Undergraduate Electrical Engineering from a modern computing context, and went through as quickly as possible while still retaining information a Computer Science undergraduate curriculum. MIT OCW is how I'm modeling this curriculum, but I'm also taking hints from Standford, University of Toronto, Royal Institute of Technology, & Technical University of Berlin.
